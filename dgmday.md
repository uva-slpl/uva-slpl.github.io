# Deep generative models in NLP


On March 22 2018 we are gathering to present and discuss work on deep generative models (DGMs) and their applications to natural language processing. 
Our schedule will include a tutorial on variational inference and DMGs, research talks, and posters.

**Registration**  we invite colleagues from UvA to [register](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSzXOnb_5_4CLPBBzTtthm-k2U_qkYe2h52IMwgDoQdY7M-w/viewform?usp=sf_link) for free

**Schedule** a complete schedule and location will be announced soon.
